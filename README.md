### Abstract

<p align="justify">

Advances in genomic sequencing have magnified our understanding of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms relevant to biodiversity conservation. As a result, the field of conservation genomics has grown rapidly. Genomic data can be effective in guiding conservation decisions by revealing fine-scale patterns of genetic diversity and adaptation. Adaptive potential, sometimes referred to as evolutionary potential, is particularly informative for conservation due to its inverse relationship with extinction risk. Yet, global coldspots in access to genomic resources impede progress towards conservation goals. We undertook a systematic literature review to characterize the global distribution of genomic resources for amphibians and reptiles relative to species richness, IUCN status, and predicted global change. We classify the scope of available genomic resources by their applicability to global change. Finally, we examine global patterns of collaborations in genomics studies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for expanded genomic resources, especially those that directly inform about adaptive potential. Our results also highlight the need for improved global collaborations in genomic research, resource sharing, and capacity building in the Global South.
